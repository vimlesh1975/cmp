Templates are installed in c:/casparcg/CMP
So If template folder is other than c:/casparcg then copy this folder and paste in your template folder. your template folder might be at D:\CasparCG Server 2.0.3\server\templates.
So after copying it should look like  D:\CasparCG Server 2.0\server\templates\CMP.

This application has been developed with screen resolution 1920x1080. So for best experience this resolution is recommended.

casparcg Server screen will not come in the space designated for it in the rihgt side of the client if server and client are on different computers.
Write the name of the screen consumer to come in its place.
